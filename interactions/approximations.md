# Interaction Approximations

This section covers various approximation methods used in quantum mechanics and molecular physics.

## Sudden Approximation
The sudden approximation is used when a perturbation occurs much faster than the characteristic time scale of the system.

## Strong-Field Approximation
The strong-field approximation is used to describe atomic and molecular processes in intense laser fields.

## Koopman's Theorem
Koopman's theorem relates ionization potentials to orbital energies in Hartree-Fock theory.

## Single-Active Electron Approximation
This approximation treats only one electron as active while the others remain frozen in their ground state orbitals.

## Frozen-Orbital Approximation
In this approximation, the orbitals of the core electrons are assumed to remain unchanged during the excitation or ionization process.

## Born-Oppenheimer Approximation
The Born-Oppenheimer approximation separates nuclear and electronic motion by assuming that nuclei move much slower than electrons.

## Franck-Condon Principle
The Franck-Condon principle states that electronic transitions occur without nuclear motion, leading to vertical transitions in potential energy diagrams.
