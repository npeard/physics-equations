# Photoionization Processes

## Tunnel Ionization
Tunnel ionization occurs when an atom is subjected to a strong electric field that suppresses the Coulomb potential barrier, allowing electrons to tunnel through.

## Over-the-Barrier Ionization (OBI)
Over-the-barrier ionization occurs when the external field is strong enough to completely suppress the potential barrier, allowing classical escape of electrons.

## Above-Threshold Ionization (ATI)
Above-threshold ionization is the process where electrons absorb more photons than the minimum required for ionization, resulting in higher kinetic energies.

An interesting question: Does the photoelectron experience braking radiation?
Where and when in the process does this occur?
