## von Neumann Equation

The time evolution of the density matrix in quantum mechanics is governed by:
$$i \hbar \dot{\rho} = [H, \rho]$$

This equation describes how the density matrix $\rho$ evolves under the influence of the Hamiltonian $H$.
It is the quantum mechanical analog of the classical Liouville equation.
