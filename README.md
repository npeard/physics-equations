# Physics Equations Repository

This repository contains a modularized collection of physics equations and concepts, organized by topic.
It is my personal reference (not exhaustive) of factors of $2\pi$, $-1$, etc., and other physics equation quirks that I refer to frequently.  
The content has been converted from LaTeX to Markdown format, following the convention of one sentence per line.

## About

This collection focuses on fundamental equations and concepts in quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, and atomic/molecular physics.
Each topic is organized into separate files for easy navigation and reference.
The equations are typeset using LaTeX-style Markdown for proper mathematical formatting.

## Usage

Each Markdown file contains the relevant equations and brief explanations for a specific physics topic.
Files follow the convention of one sentence per line for better version control and readability.
Mathematical expressions are formatted using LaTeX syntax within Markdown code blocks.

## Contributing
