# Four-Vectors in Special Relativity

In flat spacetime, the four-velocity has both covariant and contravariant forms.

## Covariant Four-Velocity
$$u_{\alpha} = \gamma (-1, v_i)$$

The covariant form has a negative time component and spatial components $v_i$.

## Contravariant Four-Velocity
$$u^{\alpha} = \gamma (1, v_i)$$

The contravariant form has a positive time component and the same spatial components.

Here $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor and $v_i$ represents the spatial velocity components.
