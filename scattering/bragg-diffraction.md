For good references, see Santra (2009) and the Wikipedia page on Structure Factors.
CXRO has good data on optical constants and atomic form factors.

## Bragg's Law
$$2 |d_{hkl}| \sin(\theta) = n\lambda$$

## Maximum Resolution
$$d_{min} = \lambda/2 \csc(\theta_{max})$$

## Square Lattice Spacing
For a square lattice:
$$\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \frac{h^2}{a^2}+\frac{k^2}{b^2}+\frac{l^2}{c^2}$$
