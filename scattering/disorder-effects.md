# Disorder and Diffuse Scattering

Most crystals only diffract out to 0.6 angstrom due to thermal effects.
Cooling gets closer to $\lambda/2$ limit.

## Thermal Effects
Temperature-dependent disorder leads to reduced diffraction intensities at high scattering angles.
The Debye-Waller factor accounts for thermal motion of atoms.

## Static Disorder
Positional disorder and compositional disorder contribute to diffuse scattering between Bragg peaks.

## Dynamic Disorder
Time-dependent fluctuations in atomic positions contribute to both elastic and inelastic scattering.
