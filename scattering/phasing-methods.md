## Patterson Function
The autocorrelation theorem states that the autocorrelation function $c(r)$ of a function $f(r)$:
$$c(r) = \int f(x) f(x+r) \,dx = \int \frac{C(q) e^{i q \cdot r}}{(2\pi)^3} \,dq$$

has a Fourier transform that is the squared magnitude of $F(q)$, $C(q) = |F(q)|^2$.
The autocorrelation of the electron density can be computed directly from the reflection intensities without computing the phases.
It is difficult to solve the structure for large molecules this way because the Patterson or autocorrelation function will have $N(N-1)$ peaks for $N$ atoms in the unit cell.
